### Predictive Maintainance of Industrial Iot based on Resources consumption by systems/Machines

- used Contiki-ng for creating Virtual Wireless sensor network.
- used Hyperledger fabric private blockchain to store the generated data securely.
- You can find all the source codes that were used for generating data and also to create a hyperledger fabric blockchain and pushing data into it in the /Sourcecodes folder.
- This data is being retrieved from the blockchain and pushed into a json file (could've used Couch DB).
- Visualized this json data in a React.js - vite web app which updates in real time (used Tremor library for data visualizations).
